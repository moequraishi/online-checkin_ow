# Angular CLI Commands 

Below you will find helpful Angular CLI Commands we have used on this project.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Shorthand codes:
You may also run `ng g c YOUR-COMPONENT-NAME` to generate a new component. Add `--no-spec` flag after `YOUR-COMPONENT-NAME` if you do not require a spec/testing file to be included.

Other commands include:

Run `ng g s YOUR-SERVICE-NAME` as a shorthand to generate services on the fly. You may also add the `--no-spec` flag to generate the service without a testing/spec file. 

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

Run `ng build --watch` to watch for constant changes and build the project on the fly.

### For production build:

Run `ng build --env=prod --watch` to build for production on the fly.
